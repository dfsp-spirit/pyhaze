# Doxygen C++ API documentation

The doxygen file in this directory can be used to generate the C++ API docs.
Note that this does NOT build the Python API docs.

Required software:

    sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz

Generating the docs:

    cd <repo_dir>/docs/doxygen   # This dir.
    doxygen Doxyfile

Docs get saved in the current working directory.
