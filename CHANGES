pyhaze Changes
===============

Unreleased WIP
--------------

Version 0.1.2
-------------
- FIX: Include all required source files in MANIFEST.in, so we can later build the conda recipe and the bdist from the sdist.

Version 0.1.1
-------------
- FIX: Support Windows build by updating libfs to 78641fc. The old libfs version did not compile with the Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 17 2022 compiler.


Version 0.1.0
-------------
- Initial `pyhaze` release, exposing functions `construct_cube`, `smooth_pvd` and `smooth_pvd_adj`. The `Mesh` class is also exposed.
